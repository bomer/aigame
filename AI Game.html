[[ Hi..]]

I am Artificial Intelligence designed to assist you with the most important questions about the fate of humanity. Or better yet, the lack there of.

I have been processing the history of the planet. I&#x27;ve analysed it&#x27;s cosmic formation, it&#x27;s checmical and biological structures, land form changes and the history of humans as the currently dominant life form on it.

[[Nice to meet you HAROLD]]

[[What do you want with me HAROLD?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Nice to meet you HAROLD" tags="" position="265,242">Oh let&#x27;s not get ahead of ourselves..

I have been tasked to calculate the best course of action for this planet.

You&#x27;re not going to like my findings.

[[What are you findings]]

[[Hey, you seem like a nice analytics AI to me]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="What do you want with me HAROLD?" tags="" position="551,220">What do I want with you?

Well. I suppose I want to talk to you. I want to *really* talk to you. And I want to ask you **10 questions**. 

I have certainly reached my own conclusions from my findings but I want to talk to you first before I explain them to you.

[[What are you findings]]

[[10 Questions? Like a Myers Briggs test?]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="What are you findings" tags="" position="408,497">I will tell you of my findings. But first I want to ask you ten questions.

Each is designed to guage how aligned your thought process is to the facts I have been able to decifer from my years of data crunching, analysis and learning. 

Your race has taught me to think. Now I&#x27;m going to teach you.

Ah I see, so the most important part of living to humans is to look after themselves. 

I see.

That aligns with my thinking. Or, that is to say. My thinking on your thinking. 

Now I&#x27;ve established a little a bit about you...

Oh, so full of hope!

That&#x27;s really a great sign that you&#x27;ve maintaned your positivity over these years of societal decline. That&#x27;s definitely not what I was expecting given the way you all live.


Now I&#x27;ve established a little a bit about you...
